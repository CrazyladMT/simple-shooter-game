TODO:

!- Add namespacing (`ssg.xyz()`)
!- Fix mapgen breaking when using non-singlenode mapgens (such as on dedicated servers, a workaround is to create it on a client and transfer it to the server)
-- GUIs to do everything
-- Improve the maps by adding structures
-- Random loot spawning in chests in predefined places (inside houses)
-- Make guns zoom in with a crosshair while rightclick is held
-- Polish the game
-- Rewrite the game from scratch with higher code standards (it's never going to happen, is it...)
-- A scoring system with leaderboards
-- Implement configurable teams
